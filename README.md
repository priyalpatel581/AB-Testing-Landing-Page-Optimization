E-news Express A/B Testing Project
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes an A/B test conducted by E-news Express to evaluate whether a new landing page improves user engagement and subscription rates compared to the old landing page.
🎯 Business Objective
E-news Express aims to understand if the new landing page design:

Increases time spent on the page
Improves conversion (subscription) rates
Performs differently across language preferences

📁 Dataset

Source: abtest.csv
Size: 100 observations
Features:

user_id: Unique identifier for each user
group: Control (old page) or Treatment (new page)
landing_page: Version shown (old/new)
time_spent_on_the_page: Minutes spent on page
converted: Subscription status (yes/no)
language_preferred: User's preferred language (English/French/Spanish)



🔍 Key Research Questions

Do users spend more time on the new landing page than the old one?
Is the conversion rate higher for the new page compared to the old page?
Does conversion depend on the user's preferred language?
Is the mean time spent on the new page the same across different languages?

📈 Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis of time spent on page
Conversion rate analysis
Language preference distribution
Bivariate analysis across different dimensions

Statistical Tests Performed

Welch's t-test (one-tailed) - Comparing time spent between old and new pages
Two-proportion z-test - Comparing conversion rates
Chi-square test of independence - Testing relationship between language and conversion
One-way ANOVA - Comparing mean time across language groups

🔬 Key Findings
1. Time Spent on Page

Result: Users spend significantly more time on the new page (median ~6 minutes) vs old page (median ~4 minutes)
Statistical Evidence: t-statistic = 3.79, p-value = 0.00014
Conclusion: ✅ Reject H₀ - Strong evidence that new page increases engagement

2. Conversion Rate

Result: New page shows higher conversion rate than old page
Statistical Evidence: z-statistic = 2.41, p-value = 0.008
Conclusion: ✅ Reject H₀ - Strong evidence that new page improves conversions

3. Language vs Conversion

Result: Conversion appears independent of language preference
Statistical Evidence: Chi² = 3.09, p-value = 0.213
Conclusion: ❌ Fail to reject H₀ - No significant relationship found

4. Time Across Languages (New Page)

Result: Mean time spent is similar across all language groups
Statistical Evidence: F-statistic = 0.854, p-value = 0.432
Conclusion: ❌ Fail to reject H₀ - No significant difference across languages

Performance by Language

🥇 English speakers: Best conversion performance
🥈 Spanish speakers: Moderate, balanced conversion
🥉 French speakers: Weakest conversion performance

💡 Recommendations
1. Adopt the New Landing Page ✅
Fully implement the new design for all users, as it significantly improves both engagement and conversions.
2. Optimize Early Engagement

Improve first 2 minutes experience
Enhance headlines and calls-to-action
Add compelling visual elements

3. Focus on French-speaking Users

Conduct qualitative research (usability testing, surveys)
Identify and address specific barriers to conversion
Consider language-specific optimizations

4. Maintain Uniform Design
Since language doesn't significantly impact performance, avoid unnecessary customization across languages.
5. Continue A/B Testing
Explore further experiments on:

Device type (mobile vs desktop)
Traffic source/referral channels
Personalized content recommendations

6. Monitor Key Metrics
Establish continuous tracking of:

Conversion rate trends
Time spent on page
User drop-off points
Language-specific performance
